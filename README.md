learning more about Forms
Im certain Im more efficent now than when I was before 
so thats good atleast, select your file (was going to do a drag and drop but I kept getting errors with the drag and drop) so I just dropped the drag and drop plan and did the simple, open a window in file explorer and make the user select the file he wants
then just like that the file gets copied and saved as a Json in the downloads Folder
rather than changing the original file I just made a copy for safety
